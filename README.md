Courseworks for NTHU, CS, Hardware Design and Lab. by Prof. LEE, CHUN-YI


This course impacts me hugely, however it's a course that I attend as much as I can.
In the beginning, I feel stressful under the tremendous workload required by the course.
However, I strive to do the coursework by myself, in the end I ground myself in a new reality,
through the whole semester, I constantly reflected on my life purpose and the journey I have been through, 
eventually I accept the hardship and become a greater person.

In this course, not only did my Verilog coding skill become better, it greatly improves my capacity in programming 
and debugging, since I have no one to count on but myself, I have spend large time debugging in the first few weeks of 
the semester, however through the process I can maintain a greater coding skill embody the concept of high cohesion and low coupling,
and I can target and minimize the scope of the programwhich may lead to potential error faster than I could have ever been, 
as a result it also improves my problem solving skill notonly limited to Verilog code but in C++ or Programming area, 
and this strongly boost my confidence.

Though I have got a relatively high score in the test, I score not that high in the courseworks.
I'm not always get a high score in every test or high performance at any time, but I can face failure
and always exert myself to perform better, in reality I'm just not good enough, but I can always be better.

I also improves my WORD skill hugely, in the first few lab report the organization of the reports are pretty naive, but
later I google it and learn to apply TOC(table of contents) and it looks just way better.

To summarize, in this course I code far more than any other programming courses, I write way more reports than any General Education courses, 
and I score lower than any course I have participated in my undergraduate program, but I greatly increases my capacity as a person in many aspects
of life, it may not be seen ostensibly, but this is the most valuable thing. 

At the end of semester, many challeges present to me during the course is nothing to me.

I can almost certainly said that this might be the most hardcore CS course in undergraduate program in NTHUCS, 
but I enjoy much than any other courses that I have participated.
